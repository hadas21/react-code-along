When a category is selected, the data is automatically fetched. This will demonstrate dependancies
Add a form or caching where serch results are stored so when a category changes, so a new API call isn't needed if the data exists.
Also add a form of data limitation, so only get top 20 results initially, and scroll will get more results.
